Ever thought of investing in stocks even though you don't know much about finances?

Ever thought of buying a costly stock of high profit returns even if your budget doesn't allow?

Do you also want someone to invest in money earning resources on your behalf even if you can invest only 100Rs per month?

Presenting you with a  **Stool** to make our finance easier and life better.

A plan to invest in a stock via group pool. Friends and strangers come
together to invest in stocks and cryptocurrency, for 
sharing the investment strategy and profit. 

If in doubt talk to our Chatbot to clarify doubts.

                                                      Invest Together Grow Together.




## How it Works ?

Here you can join a group of investors, who together invest
in a stock, fix a deadline to withdraw the amount, you can 
request admin to add new resource in a group,remove a resource or change the amount of resource.

Or you can create your unique group and  add different resource in
it, and ask other users to join you and invest with you, where
you can share ideas with each other and can grow together.
